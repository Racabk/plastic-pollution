        <ul>
        <li>Plastic poluution has become  
            one of the most serious environmental problems affecting the oceans and marine life increasingly from year to year. And it is caused by wastes and chemicals being thrown purposely or washed from mostly 
            land sources into the ocean.</li>
        <li>It affecting the world when plastic waste enters the ocean, it breaks up into smaller pieces that absorb a variety of chemicals 
            floating in the marine environment, including pesticides and toxic metals. When fish, seabirds, 
            and marine mammals eat these smaller pieces of plastic waste, they become contaminated, which later on  humans eats this sea foods and they get affected by it too. </li>
        <li>This game illustrates the impact of chemicals and plastic waste on marine life in an underwater setting. It shows how garbage and dangerous substances that destroy plants affect the water.</li>
        <li> It also indicates how everyday actions can lessen the problem if people start to reduce the amount of plastic that is purposely dumped into the ocean. 
            It will save both people and marine life as a result of enhancing the ocean environment.</li>

        <h4> <center> Direction </center></h4>
        <p> Goal: not to get killed from consuming the trashes, try to avoid them </p>
        <p>Mechanics: use arrow keys to move the fish up and down</p>
